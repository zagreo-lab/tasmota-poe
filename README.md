Custom firmware for Tube-CC2652-PoE

How to install TASMOTA firmaware on Tube-ZB-CC2652-PoE

1) You need to compile a bin on gitpod.io, in the workspace /workspace/Tasmota master, modifying 2 files:

* 'Platformio_override.ini' file which is located in the root directory â€“ /workspace/Tasmota. Open the file, scroll to the bottom, and add:
```
[env:tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE]
extends                 = env:tasmota32
build_flags             = ${env:tasmota32_base.build_flags} -DFIRMWARE_CC2652P2_POE
```


* 'user_config_override.h' file which is located in the tasmota subdirectory (/workspace/Tasmota/tasmota). Open that file, erase all its contents and replace with the file in repository

* In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, while in the /workspace/Tasmota directory, type the following:
```
platformio run -e tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE
```

Once it does, the bin file can be found in /workspace/Tasmota/build_output/firmware

2) Flashare il compilato: tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE-BRIDGE.bin
3) Dare il seguente comando: backlog wifi 0 ; Template 0, rule1 1 
4) Restart
