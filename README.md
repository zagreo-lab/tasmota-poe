# How to install TASMOTA firmware on Tube-ZB-CC2652-PoE

Even though Tasmota offers several pre-compiled firmware variants, sometimes the ready-to-flash binaries aren't enough. If you need to enable or disable some features, or simply change some parameters, then you need to compile a firmware binary yourself.

Gitpod is a web browser based online IDE. All you need to use it is to link your GitHub account. Gitpod will take care of all the necessary software package dependencies for you.

The proper method of customizing firmware compilation options is to use the user_config_override.h file. You should not change the my_user_config.h file.

> 1. You need to compile a bin on gitpod.io, in the workspace /workspace/Tasmota master, modifying 2 files:

* 'Platformio_override.ini' file which is located in the root directory â€“ /workspace/Tasmota. Open the file, scroll to the bottom, and add:
```
[env:tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE]
extends                 = env:tasmota32
build_flags             = ${env:tasmota32_base.build_flags} -DFIRMWARE_CC2652P2_POE
```


* 'user_config_override.h' file which is located in the tasmota subdirectory (/workspace/Tasmota/tasmota). Open that file, erase all its contents and replace with the file in repository

* In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, while in the /workspace/Tasmota directory, type the following:
```
platformio run -e tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE
```

Once it does, the bin file can be found in /workspace/Tasmota/build_output/firmware

Download tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE-BRIDGE.bin to your computer by right-clicking on the file and selecting 'Download'. You are now ready to flash your device.

> 2. Flash tasmota32-CC2652P2-POE-BRIDGE.bin

OTA Flash

If you already have Tasmota flashed on your device, you can use the File Upload OTA method to load the new firmware binary file.

Download tasmota-minimal.bin
Make a backup of the device configuration using the web UI Configuration menu option.
Upload tasmota-minimal.bin to your device using the web UI Firmware Upgrade selection. Choose Upgrade by file upload.
After tasmota-minimal.bin is successfully loaded, select Firmware Upgrade once again and upload the firmware file compiled using Gitpod.

> 3. Give the commands: 
```backlog Template {"NAME":"Tube ZB CC2652-PoE","GPIO":[1,1,1,1,1,3584,0,0,5536,1,1,1,3552,0,5600,0,0,0,0,5568,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1} ; module 0``` 
```backlog wifi 0 ; Template 0, rule1 1``` 

> 4. Restart
